I have produced designs for a website that meet client requirements. The design I have produced is a wireframe, with 4 different pages, 5 including the privacy policy. The client requirements included: A profile of the company itself, profiles of existing trainee web developers, job specifications and required qualifications, an on-line application form, and links to web development courses. In my wireframe I believe I have included each one of these client requirements. The first page is more of a main page, but also covers the objective of making a profile of the company, It has an image of the company, then a discription, and as a filler near the bottom is links to web development courses which also covers another objective but I felt like it was little enough to not need it's own page but I also included it on another page not just this. Also, every single page has the company logo at the top, a hamburger logo in the top right, and a link to the privacy policy at the bottom. Moving onto the second page, it covers the objective of showing off the existing trainees, so it has all 3 trainee images and descriptions, while at the top it has a bit of an introduction. The third page covers the job specifications and required qualifications objective, it contains a little introduction at the top, then a little lower is web design role description, and little lower is web developer role description, and near the bottom again is the links to web development courses so it kind of reminds the viewer as they view all the pages. The final and 4th page is the application form page which covers the application form requirement. It has a form title, info about the application form and then boxes to enter in information for your application and then a stock photo at the bottom to kind of take up space so it doesn't look completely empty and then all the other usual stuff like the link to the privacy policy, company logo, hamburger, etc. I also created a design for what it would look like if the hamburger icon is opened, and you can see it just has the 4 page categories from top to bottom. Finally, the last aspect is the privacy policy page, it is a simple page which just has a title and then the massive privacy description text which outlines the privacy policy.

Below is an image of my wireframe:

I have also produced a user flow diagram to show how the users will navigate through the website. The actual user flow diagram is fairly complicated and looks like a lot but the simple explanation is "if you click on this, it goes to this" over and over again and it keeps checking whether the user clicks the web dev courses and footer links, and if they do it obviously sends them there and if not then it stays on the page.

Below is my user flow diagram:

I have also reviewed my website proposals/designs with others to identify and inform improvements. The exact response I got from the person who reviewed my wireframe was: "I have reviewed your wireframe and have looked at some clear improvements you can add to it. First you can start by adding a picture of the job to the third page, you have added images for all of the pages but that one which can help apllicants to see what the job will look like. I also think you could benefit with a proper footer instead of just privacy polcy." So the main improvements identified were to add at least some image to my job specification page (3d) because every single page other than that one has an image and it would show off what the job may look like or entail so I have added 2 image slots opposite the text boxes which describe the web design and web developer roles and so the images could represent each one of them. The other improvement which is a very good one and important is to have a proper footer rather than just a privacy policy. This was a complete mistake from me since every website has a normal footer with social media links, privacy policy links, terms and conditions links, contact link etc. and for me to not have this and just have a privacy policy would look and function pretty bad so it is very good that my friend informed me of this improvement and in response I added the footer, kept the privacy policy link but I don't really know exactly what other links I wil have so I just said "other details and links" so when I'm developing I can have freedom.

After completing my website, I now need to test for functionality, compatibility and usability. Firstly, I tested the functionality of my website, first by making sure all the external links (to the web development courses) go to the pages correctly and work which they do. Secondly, I made sure all my internal buttons worked, so this included making sure when you click the logo it goes back to the home page / company info page, making sure the hamburger menu works and it takes you correctly to the different pages, the privacy plicy link takes you to the page correctly, and the submit application button also works and after testing all of these they work as they should. I also needed to make sure my images were displayed correctly and not broken or distorted and after checking all the images seem to be good. Next thing to test is compatibility which firstly I went on my mobile phone to see how each page is displayed and if they are displayed well and after review the company info page is good, application form page is good but when it comes down to the pages with lots of text like the existing trainees page and the job roles page the text is on one side and it is very long and theres a lot of blank space on 3/4 of the page since there is an image and then everything below and above the image is blank. I also tested on my mobile phone landscape mode and since this is more similar to computer which is what the website was designed on it definitely is better and the text is more stretched which makes it easier to read and it looks better. Finally, usability needs to be tested. I think the website is pretty easy to use, the hamburger icon which is a universal icon to signify a drop down menu which should help people know, any links are highlighted a different colour, for example the external links are blue and even have a small arrow next to them making it even easier to understand and the privacy policy link is orange as well. The company logo when clicked takes you to the home page so that makes it another way to navigate pages and it also pretty universal feature on most websites so users are expecting that to be implemented so by having it they are not disappointed. The form has grey text in the input boxes to further explain what to input so this makes it even easier to understand and use the application form section. I also decided to add at least 1 image on each page just so it looks better and so hopefully easier to use. To really make sure the usability is alright I got one of my friends to try my website and I just told them to try navigate it and while I was watching they didn't encounter any issues and their experience was smooth so I think that gives proof and evidence to the usability of the website.

Finally, the last thing I need to do is review the extent to which the website I created meets the initial client requirements. Firstly, we need to remember the client requirements, so these included creating a new section for the company's website which promotes the company to prospective employees, and in this website they wanted it to inlcude a profile of the company, profiles of the existing trainee web developers, job specifications and required qualifications, an on-line application form and links to web development courses. So now coming back to the website I have made, it is part of the company's website and it does indeed promote the company to employees which meets that client requirement. Then the first aim of the website was to include a profile of the company and that is definitely met since there is a page which speaks about Hot Beans Web and even has a picture of their logo and office. Next is profiles of the existing trainee web developers which on the website is done perfectly with the 3 existing trainee web developers and their photos and also their descriptions and this is definitely met. Next client requirement specifically is adding job specifications and required qualifications, which is where the job roles page comes in and describes amazingly the specifications of the job and also what is required in terms of qualifications and also skills so this client requirement is met. Next is an on-line application form which the website also has since there is a seperate application form page dedicated to this and again it does it spot-on and it is a simple form which allows for potential employees to apply for the company so this requirement is met. The final client requirement in terms of what the website must have is links to web development courses. I thought this wasn't too important to have it's own page so at the bottom of the company info page and the bottom of the job roles is links to external web development courses so anyone viewing if interested can work on web development if they want to in the future work as a web developer. So now finally I believe the website meets the client requirements to a very acceptable standard as I have reviewed it and it does seem to meet every single client requirement so that is what I think.
